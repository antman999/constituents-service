# constituents-service

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:antman999/constituents-service.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the cloned directory:
    ```bash
    cd constituents-service
    ```
3. You will need two terminal windows/tabs for the next steps.
4.  **In the first terminal**, set up and start the backend service:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
     *(The backend service will typically start on `http://localhost:3001`)*
5.  **In the second terminal**, set up and start the frontend application:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
6. Open the frontend URL in your browser to use the application. Both services should be up and running ðŸŽ‰

## Next steps & Improvements

Some next steps to make this service scale are:

**Backend:**

1. Create a test suite for our endpoints and logic especially the CSV export.
2. Handle auth, this should be not only for users but for elected officials to see who is actually part of the newsletter and handle analytics.
3. Think of a DB choice. We can expand into a discussion of using a key/value table or a traditional relational DB.
4. Handle our pagination better. We can think of supporting cursor based pagination.
5. Caching our constituents requests better.
6. Admin tools to delete, update constituents better.
7. Beyond auth, we should implement security best practices such as input sanitization, rate limiting, and protection against web vulnerabilities.

**Frontend:**

1. Translations, constituents can come from many different backgrounds so we should support all used languages.
2. A11Y, this should always be a top priority especially making sure our form is accessible to everyone. (color contrast, table screen readers.)
3. Mobile friendly: As of now our mobile support for this web app is functional but we could expand this for all screen sizes especially tablets and our table.
4. Elected official branding and customization. This is a crucial client side feature that can help elected officials add their touch and branding to this web app. As of now I tried to mimic Indigovs UI colors to make it stand out.
5. Better filtering tools for getting the right user information quicker.
6. SSR vs CSR, could be a good conversation.
